                <h2>Richard Xue | Secretary-General |</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Often described as political, Richard Xue, a grade 11 student at Dr. EP Scarlett High School, is overjoyed to begin the first iteration of ABMUN. As he looks back on his experiences in global affairs and politics, from his initial hesitant speeches to his present-day confident speeches at numerous Model UN conferences, he realizes that his ongoing journeys in the realm of MUN have played a significant role in shaping him. Outside of the Model United Nations community, Richard also has a strong affinity for chess and enjoys contemplating his blunders on the chessboard and finds relaxation and entertainment in watching the television series "Young Sheldon".</p>

                <h2>Brian Jiang | Director-General |</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>A befuddled sophomore imprisoned within Port Moody Secondary School, Brian is shocked-and-appalled upon receiving the opportunity to serve as the Director-General in the first iteration of ABMUN. After the hypnotic discussion regarding narcotic substances in the halls of the World Health Organization in 2021, Brian has since then developed an irreversible psychological condition that causes him to hyperventilate at the mention of any references to MUN. An avid tormentor of the dias team, Brian can be found within the conference room frantically trying to hammer Deng Xiaoping quotes into his speeches, helping to foster the international relations of Albania, and orchestrating the construction of the Death Star using British taxpayers' money. Outside of the apparatus of the Model United Nations, Brian can be spied face-palming in second-hand-embarrassment as he reads about the Waterloo campaign, delving into the detailed lore of Middle-earth, or researching about the many interesting quirks of marine porpoises. Brian looks forward to fostering a new and rewarding environment for all delegates attending ABMUN 2024!</p>

                <hr>
                <p>As a junior at Richmond Christian School, Kevin is ecstatic to serve as the USG of Committees for ABMUN 2024. Ever since his first stuttering speech in 2021, MUN has nourished his extreme passion for political discussions and debates. This non-spectator sport has allowed him to witness and participate in the collision and reaction of diverse opinions from different cultures, races, and backgrounds, and most importantly, building some lifelong friendships. Outside the conference rooms, Kevin can be caught getting bubble tea after 2 hours of intense CHUNITHM playing, waking up reluctantly for badminton training, or being addicted to the adorable beings found in cat caf√©s. Kevin looks forward to meeting every delegate and making this conference weekend an unforgettable memory.</p>
